This little utility makes it far far easier to close windows in microsoft windows.
Instead of searching for the X [top right] or right clicking on the drop down [top left], now you just right click on the title bar.
Try it--you'll never want to go back.

Update: This utility is nice [right click on title bar--close window], however I have updated my copy of nifty windows http://github.com/rogerdpack/nifty_windows/tree/master to allow "double right click anywhere" to close the current window, so take your pick [this one has a few more bugs, too].

To run: execute ./TrayIcon/TrayIcon/Release/TrayIcon.exe

Related products: Nifty Windows (allows close by right and middle click--a bit more kludgey, I'll admit).

Known bugs:  see the source for a somewhat lengthy wish list.

Collaboration welcome! (currently compiled with Visual Studio 2008...I hope--if not then download from the codeproject link below and substitute its source for mine).

This code is mostly a copy of that found in http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/MinimizedAnyWindowToTray.aspx
but modified to do the described.
